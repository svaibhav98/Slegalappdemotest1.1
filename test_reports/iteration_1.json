    "Vertical scrolling is preserved by only capturing horizontal gestures (Math.abs(gestureState.dx) > Math.abs(gestureState.dy))",
    "Swipe indicator dots correctly sync with activeTab/selectedCategoryIndex state",

    "POTENTIAL ISSUE: PanResponder is created with useRef but activeTab/selectedCategoryIndex are used inside - this may cause stale closure issues. Consider using useCallback or updating panResponder when state changes"
